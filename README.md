DarkSea Market is a plugin which allows darkforest players to sell their artifacts to each other in game.

Logging into the to the game, create a new plugin, and parse the follow line to the code area:
```javascript
export { default } from "https://df.snowtigersoft.com/darksea_market/06r3/DarkSeaMarketPlugin.js";
```

DarkSea will charge some fee of each sale, currently it is 10%.  
At least 20% of the fees will be donated to Dark Forest via Gitcoin.
